      h1 Python Environments
      div.
        This table lists available Python libraries with their respective versions.
        The header at the top lists the available environments
        and the left column describes the name and summary of the library.
      div.
        #[a(href="https://www.sagemath.org/") SageMath] is listed as a Python environment,
        because technically it is one.
        When used directly as a language, it enriches Python with additional syntax via a
        #[a(href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/repl/sage/repl/preparse.html") Preparser]
        and preloads useful objects into the namespace.
      div.
        Besides all the listed libraries you can install additional ones in your project.
