              I just found out that my #{NAME} class got by far the best course evaluations
              for any course I've taught at UCSD to date (over 85% on the favorable/&shy;unfavorable scale),
              which makes it a sure thing that I'll be teaching this course again (in some form) next year!
              Many thanks for the backend work on #{NAME}, for the course materials, for the guest lecture...

              #{NAME} provides a user-friendly interface.
              Students don't need to install any software at all.
              They just open up a web browser and go to #[a(href=URL) #{URL}] and that's it.
              They just type code directly in, hit shift+enter and it runs, and they can see if it works.
              It provides immediate feedback.
              The #[a(href="https://doc.cocalc.com/teaching-instructors.html") course management features] work really well.
