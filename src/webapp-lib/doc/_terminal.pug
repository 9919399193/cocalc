        p.
          The #{NAME} terminal is ideal for #[strong teaching/learning Linux],
          because in case you make a mistake it has your back!
        p.
          Everything runs remotely on #{NAME}'s servers!
          This means you do not have to worry about messing up your own computer,
          deal with setup and installation issues by yourself,
          or fear of losing or corrupting your own files when you make a mistake.
        p.
          #[strong Snapshots] are consistent read-only views of all your files in a
          #[a(href="https://doc.cocalc.com/project.html") #{NAME} project].
          Restore your file(s) by copying back the one(s) that were lost or got corrupted.
        p.
          Therefore, this is ideal to learn basic shell commands or more about Linux online.
