<h3>
  Measures to support accessibility
</h3>

<p>
  <span class="basic-information organization-name">Sagemath, Inc.</span> takes
  the following measures to ensure accessibility of <span class=
  "basic-information website-name">CoCalc</span>:
</p>

<ul class="organizational-effort accessibility-measures">
  <li>Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.
  </li>

  <li>We are always improving our website. We aim to meet or exceed universal
  design best practices and web accessibility standards. To provide accessible
  web experiences, we strive to: Make our content and navigation easy to see
  Make it easy to interact using a mouse, keyboard, and/or touch screens
  Provide text and audio alternatives for visuals Support using assistive
  technologies to navigate and access content Support the use of native
  accessibility features on mobile devices and tablets. We have built the site
  so that there is meaning structured into the pages so they are as inclusive
  as we can make them. As a result, mobile and assistive technology users will
  have a better experience.
  </li>

  <li>Blind and low vision users often cannot see the images we use. It is
  important for our team to see that the meaning conveyed by those images is
  available in a textual form. We try to provide alt-text for images to help
  screenreader users to understand their meaning. We want our users to get the
  most out of our site and so try to leverage approaches that are inclusive and
  flexible. Where we can, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) as they are a
  more accessible and mobile friendly image format. Effort is made to have
  links written so that they make sense even out of context.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Conformance status
</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> defines requirements for designers and
  developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines
  three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. <span class=
  "basic-information website-name">CoCalc</span> is <span class=
  "basic-information conformance-status" data-printfilter="lowercase">partially

  AA</span>.</span> <span><span class=

  <span class="basic-information conformance-meaning">some parts of the content

<p class="basic-information conformance-additions">
  CoCalc is an online service for collaborative programming, document creation,
  and course management. Content is created by our subscribers for their
  colleagues and students. Accessibility of content is therefore primarily
  determined by our subscribers who are creating content. The CoCalc team
  provides a wealth of well-known authoring tools to allow our subscribers to
  meet their individual requirements and works to assist users whenever
  questions arise.
