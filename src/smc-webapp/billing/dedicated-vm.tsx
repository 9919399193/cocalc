          A <b>Dedicated VM</b> is a specific node in the cluster, which solely
          hosts one or more of your projects. This allows you to run much larger
          workloads with a consistent performance, because no resources are
          shared with other projects. The usual quota limitations do not apply
          and you also get additional disk space attached to individual
          projects.
