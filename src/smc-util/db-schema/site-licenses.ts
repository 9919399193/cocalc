/* This will be a table of all site licenses.

TODO:
There are many fields below and statements about limits, etc., but this
is NOT all implemented yet.  **This is just the plan.**  We also might
make the limits more like quota where they are more like soft limits,
and we have a little wiggle room.

- [ ] Initially this table will be only readable/writable by the cocalc.com admins.
Later there will be a virtual table version of this that grants (read-only)
access to users.

- [ ] Add a virtual table to return data about how a given license is *actually* being used across all projects.  Idea is site_licenses.admins (and also us cocalc.com admins) will query this for active licenses to see what's going on.
