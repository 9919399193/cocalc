Table of all site licenses.

From wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_license: "A site license is a type of software license that allows the user to install a software package in several computers simultaneously, such as at a particular site (facility) or across a corporation.[1] Depending on the amount of fees paid, the license may be unlimited or may limit simultaneous access to a certain number of users. The latter is called a concurrent site license.[2]"

That's sort of what we're doing here.  We've defined a license that let's users
*use* several upgraded projects with simultaneous access limits
(e.g., number of projects at once).

A possibly confusing point is that a single University might have many site
licenses for different purposes (e.g., one license for faculty and one license
for students).
